#Hamming Code Error Detection

This repository contains a program that demonstrates error detection using Hamming code. The program is written in C language.
Description

Hamming code is an error detection and correction technique used in digital communication. It adds additional parity bits to a block of data to detect and correct errors that may occur during transmission.

This program provides two options for error detection using Hamming code:

   1) 4-bit Hamming code: This option allows you to enter a 4-bit data sequence and calculates the parity bits. It then simulates error detection by introducing an error and displays the corrected message if an error is detected.
   2) 7-bit Hamming code: This option allows you to enter a 7-bit data sequence and calculates the parity bits. It also simulates error detection by introducing an error and displays the corrected message if an error is detected.
